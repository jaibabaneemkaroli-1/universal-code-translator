# Universal Code Translator

🚀 Translate code between ANY programming paradigms using **Cultural Grammar Synthesis**

## What Is This?

This tool demonstrates a new method for translating code between paradigms while preserving semantics and showing the reasoning.

### Example: JavaScript OOP → Haskell Functional

**Input:** JavaScript class with mutable state, async operations, dependency injection

**Output:** Idiomatic Haskell using:
- State monad (for stateful computation)
- IO monad (for tracked effects)
- Reader monad (for dependency injection)

**Plus:** Full explanation of WHY the translation works

## The Method: Cultural Grammar Synthesis

The same method that works for:
- 🎵 **Music** - Synthesizing musical genres
- 🏛️ **Architecture** - Synthesizing architectural styles
- 🍽️ **Food** - Synthesizing culinary traditions
- 💻 **Code** - Synthesizing programming paradigms

## Try It

```bash
node src/demo.js
